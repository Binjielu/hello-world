# hello-world
my first repository

I'm really new to github, my goal is being able to creat mobile app and design something that will really serve the people in a better way
I'm looking forward to using github to approach my goal.
And hopefully, I'll be successful.

Thank you guys.

I always have a question for myself. How can I not be so lazy?Is there any cure for this?

I kinda tried not to be so lazy every time whenever I was working or studying.

And, how can I stop reading the stupid Chinese novels, they're useless and it's a wasting of my time.
